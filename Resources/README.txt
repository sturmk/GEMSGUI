## GEM-Selektor v.3

Welcome to GEM-Selektor v3 program!

GEM-Selektor v.3 - the interactive package for thermodynamic modelling of aquatic (geo)chemical systems by Gibbs Energy Minimization using a built-in GEMS3K chemical solver.

### Briefly about GEM-Selektor v.3

Distributed "as is" by the Laboratory for Waste Management (LES) of the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI) with two purposes:

* to promote the GEM method and software into research community;

* to gather the users feedback - vital for making the software more functional and reliable.

Permission to use the GEM-Selektor software is hereby granted free of charge for educational and research purposes, subject to acceptance of Terms and Conditions of Use. In particular, in any publication of your results obtained using the GEM-Selektor code, please, cite the web page (http://gems.web.psi.ch) and the following papers:

* Kulik D.A., Wagner T., Dmytrieva S.V., Kosakowski G., Hingerl F.F., Chudnenko K.V., Berner U. (2013): GEM-Selektor geochemical modeling package: revised algorithm and GEMS3K numerical kernel for coupled simulation codes. Computational Geosciences 17, 1-24.

Version: currently 3.10.0.

### How to run GEM-Selektor

* To run Qt GEM-Selektor application, execute the following:

```sh
./rungems3.sh
```

* For more details about command line parameters, see into `rungems3.sh`. Edit the file `rungems3.sh` (with any simple text editor) in order to ensure that GEMS3 command line parameters point to correct locations of the program resources and of modeling projects.

* comment on security and need to go to settings>Privacy&Security and Open the app is still needed. There is no way around it unless you deliver the app through the apple App Store or you get an Apple developer ID to sign the app as thrusted
